Make Application and Framework 2 spererate solutions
-> Application makes use of the Framework solution
-> This way, the Framework can be updated without changeing the app

AI Module
-> Via AIComponent

Documentation
-> Manual to explain how to use the framework

Make a tool that allows to easily make spritesheets
