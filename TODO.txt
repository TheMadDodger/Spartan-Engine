Documentation
-> Manual to explain how to use the framework

Input Manager
-> Add mouse input ples
--> World coordinates of mouse
--> Screen coordinates of mouse

Networking

BUGS:
-> InputManager: - Pressed state reacts as down state but with delay between
->				 - Mod keys are not being detected
-> Renderer:	 - Color not working replace with own color struct (4 floats)
